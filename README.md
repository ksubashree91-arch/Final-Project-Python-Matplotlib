PYTHON (NUMPY, PANDAS, MATPLOTLIB):
1. Employee Attrition & HR Analytics
 Problem: HR wants to understand why employees leave and how performance varies.
 Requirements:
1.	Load employee dataset (CSV/Excel) into Pandas.
2.	Clean and preprocess data (drop irrelevant columns, encode categorical variables if needed).
3.	Use Pandas groupby to calculate attrition rates by department, age group, and gender.
4.	Use NumPy to calculate correlation between salary, age, and attrition.

5.	PYTHON (NUMPY, PANDAS, SEABORN): 

1. Employee Salary & Performance Insights
 Problem: HR wants to analyze salary distribution, performance ratings, and promotions.
 Requirements:
1.	Load HR dataset (Employee ID, dept, salary, years of exp, performance rating).
2.	Clean and preprocess data (categorical encoding if needed).
3.	Use NumPy to calculate salary percentiles & variance.
4.	Use Pandas to group employees by department and calculate avg salary & promotion rate.
5.	Create Seaborn visualizations:
o	histplot → salary distribution
o	barplot → avg salary per department
o	violinplot → performance vs years of experience
o	pairplot → salary, experience, performance relationships
