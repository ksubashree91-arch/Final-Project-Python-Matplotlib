PYTHON (NUMPY, PANDAS, MATPLOTLIB):
1. Employee Attrition & HR Analytics
 Problem: HR wants to understand why employees leave and how performance varies.
 Requirements:
1.	Load employee dataset (CSV/Excel) into Pandas.
2.	Clean and preprocess data (drop irrelevant columns, encode categorical variables if needed).
3.	Use Pandas groupby to calculate attrition rates by department, age group, and gender.
4.	Use NumPy to calculate correlation between salary, age, and attrition.
